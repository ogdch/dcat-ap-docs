Welcome to the DCAT-AP Switzerland documentation
================================================

This page is a technical documentation of the DCAT-AP Switzerland metadata standard to help publishers get their data on the Swiss open data portal.

There are several possibilities to add metadata on the portal:

1. Use the provided form to enter all the data (*recommended for ~1-20 datasets*)
1. Upload data as RDF/XML conforming the DCAT-AP standard (*recommended for ~20-100 datasets*)
1. Provide a RDF/XML DCAT catalog endpoint for harvesting (*recommended for >=100 datasets*)


All of the above options make use of the DCAT-AP format, which is described here.
