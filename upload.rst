For publishers, OPENDATA.SWISS offers three ways to add their datasets to the metadata catalogue. One of them is through XML file upload.

I want to publish a several and/or datasets which are updated regularly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Solution ** Manually import your metadata by uploading an XML file (see explanations and example `here <dcat-ap-format.html>`_) on OPENDATA.SWISS. The file must be structured according to the `DCAT-AP standard <dcat-ap-format.html#dcat-ap-reference-documentation>`_.
