If you have a non-negligeable amount of datasets to publish, you can define them in the `DCAT-AP for Switzerland <dcat-ap-format.html>`_ format and upload that file to opendata.swiss.

You can repeat that operation each time you want to update your datasets. Just update the XML and upload again.

More informations on how to upload the file to the portal will be put here as soon as it is known.

In the meantime, you can check the `DCAT-AP for Switzerland <dcat-ap-format.html>`_.
