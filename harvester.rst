For publishers, OPENDATA.SWISS offers three ways to add their datasets to the metadata catalogue. One of them is through automatical harvesting.

I want to publish a large number of datasets and/or datasets which are updated frequently.

**Solution ** Automatically import your metadata running a metadata harvester. You can use a standard harvester on OPENDATA.SWISS (see examples `here <http://opendata.swiss/harvesters/`_) or custom-develop my own.
