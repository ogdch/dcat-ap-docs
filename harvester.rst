Harvester
================

If you have a rather large amount of datasets (>= 100), you can use our harvesters to automatically update them at regular intervals.

Instructions on how to do that will be publised here as soon as available. In the meantime, you can already prepare your metadata in the `DCAT-AP for Switzerland <dcat-ap-format.html>`_ format.
